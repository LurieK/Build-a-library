## Object Exploration Projects

This code repository contains two projects aimed at exploring objects, getter and setter methods in JavaScript.

## Media Project

The `Media` project demonstrates the implementation of a class hierarchy for different types of media, such as books, movies, and CDs. It showcases the usage of classes, inheritance, getter and setter methods, and various operations related to media objects.

## School Project

The `School` project focuses on building a class hierarchy for different types of schools, including primary, middle, and high schools. It showcases the usage of classes, inheritance, getter and setter methods, and includes functionality to retrieve quick facts about a school and pick a substitute teacher randomly.

## Media Project Usage

1. Open the `media.js` file in your preferred code editor.
2. Review the `Media` class and its subclasses: `Book`, `Movie`, and `CD`.
3. Explore the usage of getter and setter methods, toggling check-out status, adding ratings, calculating average ratings, and shuffling songs.
4. Modify the code or create additional instances to further practice and experiment with media objects.

## School Project Usage

1. Open the `school.js` file in your preferred code editor.
2. Review the `School` class and its subclasses: `Primary`, `Middle`, and `High`.
3. Learn about the getter methods, the `quickFacts` function, and the `pickSubstituteTeacher` static method.
4. Create instances of the school classes and experiment with the getter and setter methods.

Feel free to further customize the README file based on your specific needs and add any additional information or details that you'd like to include.
